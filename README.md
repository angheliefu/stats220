## What is STATS220?
STATS220 is a course I am currently undertaking at the University of Auckland, led by Anna Fergusson. In brief, this course explores the handling of data, including _"data aqcuisition, storage, retrieval, manipulation, and management."_ - ([STATS220 Course outline](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1213)).


## What is Project 1?
Project 1 is my first assignment in this course; an introduction to the space of data technologies. It consists of 3 parts:
1. Setting up a GitHub account and repo (yes...you are looking at this first part right _now_)
2. Creating a meme
3. Creating an HTML
